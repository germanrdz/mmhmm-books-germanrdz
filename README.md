## Stuff I ran into

- Margins and paddings are not very well structured inside figma, they are not multiples and I cannot follow a good em strategy at sizing at my css.

- Block contents are not properly defined in figma, is hard to calculate how much spacing should be between components, eg. form fields, containers

- Icons are delivered in a weird way,

  - X icon is HTML/CSS instead of svg. could be better if asset? or at least delivered in HTML/CSS format instead of weird figma rectangles
  - trash icon is a weird character for an specific font, depends on font.

- Typing for react-hook-forms was a bit too complicated almost quit using the library

- Image component from NextJS has breaks the app if the URL provided is not a valid URL. This made testing/troubleshooting difficult
